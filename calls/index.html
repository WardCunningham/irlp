<H2>About this Map</h2>
<p>The lines on this map represent calls in progress on the 
<a href=http://www.irlp.net>irlp network</a>
of amateur radio stations.
Black lines are station to station calls.
Gray lines are party line calls placed through reflectors.
Each frame shows the activity as reported in the 
<a href=http://status.irlp.net/nohtmlstatus.txt>irlp status</a>
plain text file which is sampled every 10 minutes.
(Calls under 10 minutes can be missed.)
The movie starts 24 hours ago, proceeds to the present, and then repeats indefinitly with progress marked by the relentless progression of the sun.
</p><p>
Stations are added to the map as they place calls.
A station that does not report its location is plotted in the North Atlantic ocean.
(Errors in our projection algorithm cause other stations to be plotted offset from their proper locations.)
</p><p>
The map is drawn with a
<a href=World.java>java applet</a>.
If you don't see the map, perhaps you have java disabled or you are using an older web browser that does not support java version 1.2.
The applet reads a 
<a href=movie.cgi>movie script</a>
which is generated by the server from the currently available data.
This applet is released as open source software under the
<a href=http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>gnu general public license</a>
version 2. It is one of 
<a href=http://c2.com/~ward/morse/>many projects</a>
I've persued connecting amateur radio and computers.
